# CONSTRUCTION-PROGRESS-MONITORING
Project Description:
This project is centered on using drones to provide efficient and frequent surveillance of construction sites. Its main objective is to streamline site maintenance by deploying drones to monitor various sections of a building. Initially, drones scan a designated part of the site, collect data, and upload it to the cloud, making it accessible to project partners and supervisors. This allows them to review the building progress and oversee site activities from a distance, saving both time and resources. Utilizing drones for surveillance reduces the need for human labor in hazardous areas, resulting in significant cost savings.

Components Used:

Drones: The project requires high-endurance drones capable of withstanding natural elements for effective surveillance.
AWS Cloud: A cloud storage solution for convenient and centralized data access and storage.
LiDAR Sensor: LiDAR sensors enable 360-degree object scanning for comprehensive site monitoring.
Grafana: Used for real-time data visualization, aiding in better decision-making and oversight.
Objectives:
In large-scale construction projects, such as buildings potentially reaching 100 floors, it can be challenging and unsafe for humans to monitor every part. Additionally, certain areas may be difficult for humans to access. Drones help address these issues, making site monitoring more manageable, safer, and cost-effective.
